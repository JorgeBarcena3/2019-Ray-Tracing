# Ray Tracing Rendering

In this project, I intend to render a simple scene with a **ray tracing** technique. It is programmed from scratch and does not use any external library. This projecto create a .ppm image files, that we can convert to .png or .jpg with [this tool.](https://convertio.co/es/ppm-png/)

# Classes

Currently my program have 10 classes, plus a file called "main.cpp", which is what is executed when the program is launched. The project in the visual studio is a console project, but at the end of the program, an image file is created (.ppm). You can read more documentation about the classes in [this document](https://github.com/JorgeBarcena3/Ray-Tracing-Rendering/blob/master/documentation/JorgeBarcena_RayTracing.pdf).
